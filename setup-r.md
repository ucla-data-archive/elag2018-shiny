## R

[R](https://www.r-project.org) is a programming language that is
especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical
analysis. To interact with R, we use
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

### Windows

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU)  
Install R by downloading and running [this .exe
file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the
[RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop/#download).
Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run
the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select
"Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems
may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

### macOS {#r-macosx}

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg)  
Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg
file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the
[RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop/#download).

### Linux {#r-linux}

You can download the binary files for your distribution from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your
package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run
`sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install R`).
Also, please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop/#download).
